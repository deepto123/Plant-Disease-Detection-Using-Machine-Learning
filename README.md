# Abstract:
Crop diseases are a noteworthy risk to sustenance security, however their quick distinguishing proof stays troublesome in numerous parts of the world because of the non attendance of the important foundation. Emergence of accurate techniques in the field of leaf-based image classification has shown impressive results. This paper makes use of segmentation, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms in identifying between healthy and diseased leaf from the data sets created. In ur proposed paper we have:-
  * Used different types of segmentation technique to segment the plant leaf for better 
preprocessing.
* Used different kinds of CNN model to extract features from segmented leaves.
* Applied different classification algorithms on the feature-extracted dataset.
* Applied ensemble method for result analysis.
